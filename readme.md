 # Auto Flutter Localizator

﻿ This is a simple localization generator for flutter. It simply takes english .arb file and puts it into the 
chat gpt to generate a new files for languages you choose.

﻿ To make it work you need to add a config file next to the executable binary.
The template config file is nested into this repository.

Tested flutter dependencies: 
- flutter_localizations

﻿ # P.S.
  
﻿ This is actually not intended to work on a huge localization files and other approaches than one used in this program.
If you find any issues while using this program or has some recommendations on how to improve it - feel free to reach out me 
or create an issue in this repository ;).
